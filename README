Makefile and library for the SparkFun samd21 Mini breakout board
----------------------------------------------------------------

I only have one Arduino board, so why have tons of dependencies and generic
build scripts for tons of targets?

I started with the Arduino IDE to get the SAMD boards and SparkFun board
definitions and the Arduino-Makefile project, then ripped out only the parts
I need and dumped them into my own Makefile.

COMPONENTS:

  * Arduino-Makefile
    - https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile
    - Ran this makefile to see how the toolchains were called and what was
      compiled so I could write my own makefile
    - The ard-reset-arduino python script is copied directly from that repo
    - This project is great, but too automagic for my tastes and too complex to
      easily customize

  * SparkFun-SAMD-core
    - SparkFun SAMD Arduino core
    - https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards
    - Version 1.4.0, I copied the files form ~/.arduino15 rather than directly
      importing from the git repo
    - Currently have only the core and variant files, might need to grab the
      libraries and more later on

  * CMSIS
    - ARM CMSIS 5.3.0
    - https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5
    - just the Include directory, and Lib/GCC/libarm_cortexM0l_math.a

  * CMSIS-Atmel
    - https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoModule-CMSIS-Atmel
    - The Atmel (Microchip) download link is broken, so I used the Arduino
      module from github
    - Version 1.2.0
    - Just the files I need from the CMSIS-Atmel/CMSIS/Device/ATMEL dir:
      sam.h, samd.h, samd21/

ARCH LINUX PACKAGES:
  * arm-none-eabi-gcc       8.1.0-1
  * arm-none-eabi-binutils  2.30-1
  * arm-none-eabi-newlib    3.0.0.20180226-2
  * bossa (aur)             1.8-1
    - the internet says that Arduino forked bossa and the upstream version
      doesn't work, but the AUR package worked just fine for me

DEVIATIONS:
  * The Arduino IDE ships with GCC 4.8, which is really dang old. There's open
    github issues to updated it, but they haven't been acted on.
  * Arduino-Makefile enables LTO for GCC >= 4.9, but LTO doesn't actually work.
    It compiles just fine but the program doesn't run when flashed to the board.
    Without LTO, GCC 8.1 works just fine it seems.
  * I'll fix a couple compiler warnings in the Arduino and CMSIS code
